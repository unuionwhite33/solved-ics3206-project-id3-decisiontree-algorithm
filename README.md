• This project is about the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm.• Obtain two or more classification datasets from https://archive&#x2;beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.o It is up to you to choose whichever datasets you like but choosethem wisely.o Make sure that at least one of the datasets you choose has at leastone attribute with continuous values.o Make sure that the target attribute (label) of at least one of thedatasets you choose can have more than two possible values(not simply binary yes/no classification). For example, theinstances in the wine datasets belong to one of three differentclasses.o You will need to split the datasets into training sets andvalidation sets; make sure that there is enough data to do this.• You are required to implement the ID3 algorithm yourself – do not use anexisting implementation (or copy someone else’s work).• Your implementation needs to support continuous-valued attributes.• Experiment with your implementation on the datasets you have chosenand discuss your results.• In your implementation make sure to include a method (whichever oneyou like) to deal with overfitting.• Experiment with this overfitting countermeasure and discuss yourresults.• If you need to, feel free to use any external libraries help you to import(read) the datasets. The datasets are plain text files, so reading themyourself shouldn’t be a big deal.Report:• You do not need to extensively discuss how ID3 works. However, describethe methods you used to select attribute nodes, and how you deal withcontinuous values and overfitting.• Please write a good report. Describe the datasets you chose and why,describe your methodology, conclusions, etc…• In your report, briefly discuss one alternative approach which is suitablefor the task. Speculate on whether you think it would perform better orworse than ID3.• I am expecting a good evaluation and discussion regarding the results youobtained. Use a proper experimental procedure discussing your setup(e.g., training/validation split), expected outcomes, results, and discuss.Statement of completion – MUST be included in your reportItem Completed (Yes/No/Partial)Dataset selection and importID3Support continuous attributesOverfitting managementGood discussion on an alternative methodExperiments and evaluationIf partial, explain what has been doneMarking BreakdownDescription Marks allocate
